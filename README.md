# Express.js - Empty or Invalid JSON Request Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where parsing JSON request bodies fails when the body is empty or contains invalid JSON.  The server doesn't handle these scenarios gracefully, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Problem Description

When an empty or malformed JSON request is sent to an Express.js route that uses `express.json()`, the middleware might not properly handle it, resulting in an empty object (`{}`) being logged instead of the expected error or empty body.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error handling to catch and manage situations where JSON parsing fails.  This includes explicitly checking for empty bodies and handling parsing errors to prevent unexpected behavior and provide informative error responses to clients.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/user` with an empty or invalid JSON body using a tool like curl or Postman.
5. Observe the server's response and console output.
